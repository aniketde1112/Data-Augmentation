**Data augmentation** is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of a dataset by creating modified versions of existing data samples. Itâ€™s especially common in fields like image processing, where it helps improve model generalization and reduce overfitting. By transforming data in various ways, models can learn from a more diverse dataset without needing additional data collection.

**Common techniques include**:
- **Flipping** (horizontal/vertical)
- **Rotation**
- **Cropping**
- **Scaling and resizing**
- **Color adjustments** (brightness, contrast, saturation)
- **Noise addition**

In text and audio data, augmentation might involve synonyms, paraphrasing, or time-stretching.

Overall, data augmentation is crucial when data is limited, as it effectively "boosts" the dataset's variability, enhancing model robustness.
